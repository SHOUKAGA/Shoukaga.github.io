        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there, I am Tiger or better known as 'Prez' on Discord. I decided to create this page for my current and future projects.</p>
        <p>I am a computing student who has good knowledge in the programming language Python, and I have a basic understanding of SQL (what I am not fond of using  due to me being able to use it on a website page).</p>
        <p>I also have a hobby designing aircraft and on occasion small arms, for aircraft I use the game Flyout and for designs of them and small arms I use Inkscape. I might not be the best as being a graphical designer, but I still give it my all even if it is not perfect.</p>
    </section1>
    <section2>
        <h2>My current projects</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of a few of my current projects I am working on:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Sakura Heavy Industries</dt>
                <dd>Fictional Japanese corporation who specialise in aircraft such as the SHI-15, or SHI-32</dd>
            <dt>Euravia / Euravia Weapon System</dt>
                <dd>Euravia is a fictional French aerospace company, its name is similar to 'Panavia', and Euravia Weapon Systems is the weapons division of the company. I also used it for PropPunk for a weapons manufacturer</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>A few of my aircraft projects</h3>
        <dt>SHI Raven II</dt>
            <dd>Supersonic variable geometry bomber like the B-1 or Tu-160, but smaller than both, it offers a smaller profile and can go as fast as them but not in range sadly (currently that is)</dd>
        <dt>SHI-32 Phantom Fox</dt>
            <dd>Stealth fighter meant to compete with the YF-23 and YF-22 in the ATF program, a joint development of Rockwell International and Sakura Heavy Industries, though never chosen for the program it would be developed secretly by SHI.</dd>
        <dt>Euravia E-Q89</dt>
            <dd>Refueling drone designed and manufactured by Euravia as a one off to show drones can do aerial refuelling like the Boeing MQ-25 Stingray, only significantly more French and European</dd>
        <dt>SHI Constilate</dt>
            <dd>The Constilate (fake word, google thinks is constipation what is sad to think a bomber has that) It would have an internally designated by SHI as "Zero Two" a reference to Zero Two herself</dd>
        <p>As seen above are some of my current projects and they are in partial active development as I go from one to the other and back to the other, I never finish them as I always want to improve them like the Lexus LFA's development.</p>
