        <dt>Euravia Ghost Assault rifle</dt>
            <dd>An Assault rifle based initially around the HK33 and STG 53 Battle rifle. It is a small yet powerful 5.56mm NATO based rifle with similar performance to other ARs of the same class. Though it has a variant that the Sachsonian Military could use that would use a custom 5.5mm cartridge.</dd>
        <dt>Euravia Akula Battle Rifle</dt>
            <dd>This battle rifle is a slightly enlarged variant of the Ghost AR to fire the 7.62mm NATO cartridge. The Ghost and Akula share roughly 38% of their firing mechanism internals, though the Akula utilises more stronger internals for the firing mechanisms for the large ammunition. In total both share about 15% of their internals with each other.</dd>
        <dt>Euravia M1943 pistol</dt>
            <dd>This semi auto pistol was designed for the Sachsonian Military as a service pistol, and this is based on the M1911A1 and Luger.</dd>
        
            <dt>The United Emirates of Damaska</dt>
            <dd>A proposed fictional nation created by me based around the Middle East. It is a monarchy and has existed since 1900 after the unification of the states. More lore will be on a Google Doc soon.</dd>

    <dl>
        <dt>Euravia LA-08</dt>
            <dd>A lever action rifle designed and manufactured by Euravia Weapon Systems. It was designed around a few rifles like the K98 for its stock or other lever action rifles. It fires the .458 Win Mag round and is intended for large game hunting though has been service in the Sachsonian Military since 1967 as a powerful rife.</dd>
        <dt>Euravia Wiesel</dt>
            <dd>This little RC demo vehicle was initially used to demolish building in a controlled manner where people cannot plant explosives but has been used by the Sachsonian Military for anti tank combat, it operates similar to the Goliath tracked mine though with 4 wheels instead of tracks.</dd>

    <h2>What is Prop Punk?</h2>
    <p>You might be asking yourselves, what is Prop Punk?</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Prop Punk is a relatively small universe originally created by the American YouTube Messier 82 (named after his favourite galaxy). You can find more at Propedia (link at the bottom), it was co-created by Safeish and Pelicannot. I have no main affiliation apart from being a company in Prop Punk.</p>
    <p>In Prop Punk there are nation and companies from my Euravia weapon systems or Safeish's Saqalona, a company and nation respectfully. It has its own currency called para what is 15 USD to 1 Para, though for simplicity the USD is based on 2023 pricing.</p>
