    <h2>This page is dedicated to me specifically and will talk about me and what I do</h2>

    <h3>This will go into more detail than the home page</h3>
    <p>Hi there, I am Tiger or better known as 'Prez' on Discord. I am a computing student, and I love computers. I am also in the beginning stages of being a software developer.</p>
    <p>Like this website I am not perfect with coding what is ironic as that is what I am studying. I am also volunteering at a museum in the tech department with various and good skills, though I have done other stuff than It being more physical related. <break> </p>
        <p>Like I said on the home page I have a good knowledge into the programming language Python and basic knowledge in SQL.</p>

    <h3>A sneak peak of a project</h3>
    <img src="static\Images\Raven_II_Night.png" alt="Picture of a bomber at night">
    <p>Wait a minute... the sneak peak is ruined as the image is of the plane in the background. But you may guess its name if you look in the right spot.</p>
