# Shoukaga.github.io

This is my main site for my projects and activities
It is basic and I am no expert in making good HTML pages, especially since the CSS I am using is borrowed and tweaked from a friend's website
It will soon be used for more professional things such as my coding projects and not my plane projects or PRP projects (Click on the website to know more about Prop Punk)
For somereason it is not working currently
