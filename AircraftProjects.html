    <h2>Here is a page dedicated on the aircraft I have created</h2>
    </dl>
        <dt>SHI Raven II</dt>
            <dd>Supersonic variable geometry bomber like the B-1 or Tu-160, but smaller than both, it offers a smaller profile and can go as fast as them but not in range sadly (currently that is). It is also the background of my website.</dd>
        <dt>SHI Raven II EW</dt>
            <dd>This variant of the Raven II had 4 prototypes to it and was tested in a mock battle far out at sea and at the Benefield Anechoic Chamber, and same for its base variant as well for its electronic suite due to SHI's own Anechoic Chamber was in development based on the B.A.F.</dd>
        <dt>SHI-32 Phantom Fox</dt>
            <dd>Stealth fighter meant to compete with the YF-23 and YF-22 in the ATF program, a joint development of Rockwell International and Sakura Heavy Industries, though never chosen for the program it would be developed secretly by SHI. It would go onto be around as good as the F-22 in performance</dd>
        <dt>Euravia E-Q89</dt>
            <dd>Refuelling drone designed and manufactured by Euravia as a one off to show drones can do aerial refuelling like the Boeing MQ-25 Stingray, only significantly more French and European. Its current state is it can fly with its two wing mounted engined on it's cranked arrow delta wing. It also uses a conventional tail for low speed flight</dd>
        <dt>SHI Constilate</dt>
            <dd>The Constilate (fake word, google thinks is constipation what is sad to think a bomber has that) It would have an internally designated by SHI as "Zero Two" a reference to Zero Two herself.</dd>
        <dt>SHI-53</dt>
            <dd>VTOL jet based around the Harrier Jump Jet. It uses a mix of the Pegasus engine and a normal afterburning low bypass turbofan. First flew back in 8th January 1968, around a month after the Harrier took flight. It was an early experimental evolution of the Pegasus engine to see if it was possible and it was to various success, it got the one off aircraft to go Mach 1.1 on a few flights over its 1000 flight hours over the span of 4 years. By 1972 the aircraft was grounded and SHI were happy with the results, and the data was useful for VTOLs down the line. Currently and where it has been resting since 1972 is SHI's HQ on a pedestal at the front entrance inside and surprisingly is in flying condition and could fly if needed.</dd>
        <dt>SHI-6A</dt>
            <dd>WW2 Propeller carrier based fighter, it was a competitor to the A6M Zero and performed around the same, though boasted slightly longer range. It was effective killing American F4U-A1s and other carrier based aircraft, there was even the B variant that was used by kamikazes to bomb carrier groups and other naval ships to various degrees</dd>
        <dt>SHI-72 Phantom</dt>    
            <dd>A Mach 3 spy plane like the Blackbird, but was used as a "test bench" but in reality was used by Japan to get reconnaissance data and obviously test bench data for future aircraft.</dd>
        <dt>SHI-89 Kitsune of the Skies</dt>
            <dd>This high altitude aircraft is a powerful reconnaissance aircraft designed and built by SHI and used by Japan since its introduction in 1961, and like the SHI-71 it was a Japanese black project.</dd>
        <dt>SHI-65 Phantom II</dt>
            <dd>Stealth fighter similar to the F-35 in size and overall power, it was introduced into the Japanese Self Defence Force on the 16th August 2014, though not known to the public until 2018.</dd>
        <dt>SHI-97 Target Drone</dt>
            <dd>First conceived in the late 70's and prototyped in 1978, it first flew on the 22nd of August 1980. It was put into service as a target by 22nd November 1981 due to flaws with the drone's flight surfaces</dd>
        <dt>SHI NFF-12</dt>
            <dd>Experimental 1948 turboprop night fighter originally conceived and tested with the SHI-608A12 to test is the aircraft was even viable back in late 1945. It saw service from 1949 to 1973 when it was used as a target drone with being converted into a drone and many were grounded by late 1974 due to the parts for them becoming rare and by then it was obsolete and was put in museums or a few used as targets.</dd>
        <dt>SHI-73A</dt>
            <dd>A large and record breaking cargo plane, it used experimental high powered high bypass engines to push its large 800 ton payload and the airframe itself into the sky, though had to land shortly after due to one engine beginning to melt and the airframe having metal fatigue due to the weight and due to the many tests it was given. It currently sits without its engines as the center piece to a large museum near SHI's HQ. </dd>
        <dt>SHI Shoukaku</dt>
            <dd>A 1960's attack aircraft built and designed by Sakura Heavy Industries, though based around the Blackburn Buccaneer as you can see with the Shoukaku. The Shoukaku served from 1963 to 2008 when it was finally retired from use by Japan.</dd>
        <dt>General Dynamics/Sakura Heavy Industries EF-111A Raven II</dt>
            <dd>While I have not built the aircraft in Flyout yet, I have designed this black project upgrade. It would be a joint effort of General Dynamics and SHI with the airframe while SHI and Northrop Grumman worked on the electronic suite. While publicly introduced in 2003, it was flying and in use ever since the plan was conceived 2 years before the Aardvark's retirement.</dd>



            <p>As seen above are my current projects and they are in partial active development as I go from one to the other and back to the other, I never finish them as I always want to improve them like the Lexus LFA's development.</p>
